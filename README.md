# Project Innovation - P.O.G.O.

P.O.G.O. is a game developed for android devices, which uses the mobile device's gyroscope and microphone to create a challenging endless runner.
The project was developed as a second year Creative Media and Game Technologies project at Saxion University of Applied Sciences by Team Based, consisting of Alex Wójtowicz and Lisanne Westeneg as programmers, Julian Riel and Ryan Hermina as designers, Felix Gaasbeek and Wouter van Ham as artists.

## Gampelay
The world class super criminal of Super Metropolis with a background as a hacker, Joshua is interested in one thing and one thing only, to freely do whatever he wants whenever he wants. Every time he’s about to get caught, he always slips away, whether it be from his sheer luck or his cunning thinking. To him freedom is all that matters so why not cause a little bit of chaos and money for the fun of it along the way for entertainment? To him, he’s just expressing his ideology of what it means to be in a utopia. If people want to get upset about it, that’s on them. 

So why does Joshua want the P.O.G.O so badly? His phone died and he needs a new charger. Oh and I guess cause “it looks cool”.  
Now, Joshua is chased by the SUPER FBI and has to escape from them using the P.O.G.O. to jump from rooftop to rooftop.
